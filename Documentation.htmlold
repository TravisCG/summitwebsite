ChIP-seq data collection we used the NCBI SRA and ENCODE database as source. The compiled dataset consists of 1999 members. We sought to collect experiments with
different target proteins and cell type origins as many as possible. The procession of downloaded raw data was carried out with an in-house developed ChIP-seq 
analysis pipeline. This includes among others mapping (BWA), peak calling, tagdirectory creation and data visualization steps. Then the semi-processed data has 
undergone various processing steps.

	Peaksplitter and filtering Identifying peaks with well defined maxima was crucial at the early stage of data processing because the false positively 
identified peaks could spoil the result of protein position prediction. The peak summit (maxima) shows the highest coverage of the region and are known to 
more-or-less coincide with the center of corresponding DNA elements in the case of transcription factors. That is the reason why we needed regions where the
summit position/positions can be clearly defined. Current programs use different strategies for peak prediction (evaluate the peak prediction reproducibility
or using false discovery rates (FDR) (1)) which dramatically decrease the false positive rates. Unfortunately, the filtering algorithms needed to be differently
parameterized per experiment which makes the automation of processing large set of data more difficult. To complete the filtration, we developed a pipeline to 
reduce even further the false positive discovery rate. Firstly, we used PeakSplitter summit predictions, which was developed to split subpeaks (in case of 
overlapping peaks) and thus gives more accurate local maxima. The peaks of a transcription factors (TFs) usually appear concentrated narrowly, showing more-or-less
a Gaussian bell curve like shape due to the random fragmentation and their narrow binding surface (especially after extension of reads to the expected fragment 
length) (MACS). Remarkably high signal and narrow enrichment can refer to insufficient discard of read duplicates or to library preparation artifacts 
(Bastiaan Star 2014 et. al; Steven R. Head et al. 2014). To avoid false positive results, we pre-filtered the read duplicates (part of our in-house developed 
ChIP-seq analysis pipeline) and produced a perl script which classify and filter the subpeaks considering their sizes and shapes. The first two parameters are 
responsible to detect the previously mentioned large signal intensity increase (one base to another). In these calculations, the peaks are considered coverage 
histograms, and the positions of median, first and third quartile were used.

	Motif optimization and recovery of their locations Identification of the exact position of transcription factor binding sites served as the basis of 
our database. These motif instances were not only the collection of regulatory regions but also were used as reference points (the centre of the motif) in summit 
position analysis. Our primary goal was to create a consensus binding site sets for as many transcription factor as we can. To perform this, we used the JASPAR CORE 
database which is a “curated, non-redundant set of profiles, derived from published collections of experimentally defined transcription factor binding sites for 
eukaryotes.” This incorporates 512 non-redundant motif. In the early stages of our analysis, we attempted to pair all motifs with proper ChIP-seq experiments from 
our collection (valamelyik táblázat). Sevaral motifs lacking NGS data, for historical reason: CORE was built to create familial binding profiles for as many structural 
classes of transcription factor classes as possible. Large set of motif could be find in literature with no available sequence data. We could connect 281 motifs 
to at least one ChIP-seq data because several cases no sequence and NGS data was available. These motifs underwent optimization, whereby the peak regions of 
proper ChIP-seq experiments were scanned to find similar motif enrichments (homer link). The optimized motifs were manually selected to find the most identical ones 
to the given motifs. This step maximized the number of specific motif instances which were identified in the next step. Numerous tools can be used to find the 
occurrences of individual motifs. Instead of choosing from the many possibilities, we combined 3 popular methods: HOMER, FIMO and MAST. The positions which were 
identified by at least two programs (to identical positions) as the exact position was identified at least by two programs Serves as first filtering step. 
The position which were identified as instance to a given motif at least by two programs, were selected in the first step of filtering. Considering the motif 
scores (default homer, mast and fimo scores) and the distance of closest summit (using the list of paired motif-ChIP-seq experients) we calculated a weighted 
motif value. All concerned ChIP-seq peaks were attempted to pair with the closest motif with highest value. The distance cut of was +/- 50 base pair. Then we 
created non-redundant motif sets with filtering the identical (position, direction) motif occurrences. Even in the case of palindromic sequences we could identify 
motif directions due the flanking regions and the positional preferences of summits. In the previously mentioned step and in the following analysis the closestBed 
(feature of bedtools) was used to measure directly the distance between the centre of motifs and summits. The base after the geometric middle serves as centre for 
motifs whose length is even.
